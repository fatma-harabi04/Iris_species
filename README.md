#  Iris Dataset Exploration & Visualization

This project explores the classic [Iris flower dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), a famous multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher. It’s commonly used for pattern recognition and classification demonstrations.

## Project Structure

- **Data loading and cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Histograms per species and feature
  - Scatter plots comparing features
  - Correlation observations
- **Seaborn visualizations**:
  - Pairplots for all features
  - Petal vs sepal distributions
-

## Files Included

- `Project.ipynb`: The main notebook with code, plots, and insights.
- (Optional) `Iris.csv`: The dataset file if not loaded via `sklearn`.
- This `README.md`

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## What I Learned

Through this project I practiced:
- Modular EDA using clear visual tools
- Comparing statistical distributions across classes
- Visualizing dimensional overlap and cluster tendencies
- Pushing a cleaned and structured project to GitHub!

##  How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the plots and insights.
